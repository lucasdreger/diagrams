# Draw.io Workflow Guide

This document explains how our GitHub Actions workflow processes Draw.io files in this repository, including the special handling for filenames with spaces.

## Overview

The `drawio-convert.yml` workflow automatically converts `.drawio` files to SVG and HTML formats when changes are pushed to the repository. It also maintains a changelog of all diagram changes in `html_files/CHANGELOG.csv`.

## Support for Files with Spaces

This workflow fully supports filenames with spaces in them. You can create and modify files like:
- `Marketing Plan 2025.drawio`  
- `System Architecture - Version 2.drawio`
- `Team Diagram - Q3 Review.drawio`

The workflow processes only files that were changed in the current commit, including those with spaces in their names. This ensures that:
1. Only modified diagrams are converted and added to the changelog
2. Files with spaces are handled properly without breaking the processing
3. The changelog accurately reflects just the files that were changed in each commit

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Conversion**: Converts all modified `.drawio` files to SVG and HTML
2. **Changelog Generation**: Records all changes with complete metadata including:
   - Date and time of change
   - Author (from git commits)
   - Diagram name
   - Action type (New/Modified)
   - File path
   - Commit message
   - Version number
   - Commit hash
3. **Version Tracking**: Implements semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR) for diagrams
4. **SharePoint Integration**: Uploads the changelog to SharePoint for wider visibility
5. **Special Handling for Filenames with Spaces**: Custom logic to ensure files with spaces are processed correctly
6. **Change Tracking**: Uses git commit hashes to link each change to its specific commit
7. **Microsoft Teams Notifications**: Sends notifications to a Teams channel on workflow success or failure

## How Filenames with Spaces are Handled

Files with spaces in their names (e.g., "System Architecture - Version 2.drawio") require special handling in shell scripts. Our workflow uses the following techniques:

1. **Finding Files with Spaces**:
   ```bash
   find drawio_files -name "*.drawio" -type f | grep " " > /tmp/files_with_spaces.txt || true
   ```

2. **Dedicated Processing Function**:
   - All files are processed with a dedicated function that handles spaces properly:
   ```bash
   process_diagram_file() {
     local file_to_process="$1"
     # Processing logic that handles spaces correctly
   }
   ```

3. **Line-by-Line File Reading**:
   ```bash
   while IFS= read -r changed_file || [ -n "$changed_file" ]; do
     process_diagram_file "$changed_file"
   done < /tmp/changed_files.txt
   ```

4. **File Path Storage with Newlines as Separators**:
   - We store paths in temporary files with one path per line
   - This avoids issues with spaces in filenames that break word splitting

5. **Proper Quoting Everywhere**:
   - All variables are properly quoted when used in commands
   - This preserves spaces in filenames throughout the workflow

## Workflow Process

1. **Detect Changed Files**: Identifies which `.drawio` files were modified in the commit
2. **Find Files with Spaces**: Explicitly identifies files with spaces in their names
3. **Process Each File**: 
   - Converts to SVG with `drawio -x -f svg -o "$output_path" "$input_file"`
   - Creates HTML wrapper
   - Determines change type (New/Modified) and version
   - Extracts the commit hash for tracking
4. **Update Changelog**: Adds entries for each processed file with all metadata including commit hash
5. **Commit Changes**: Commits the generated SVG/HTML files
6. **Upload to SharePoint**: Uploads the changelog with complete metadata including commit hashes

## Manual Regeneration

The automatic workflow only processes diagrams that were changed in the current commit. If you need to regenerate all SVG and HTML files (for example, if some files were deleted or you want to update all files after a template change), you can use the manual regeneration workflow:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Select "Regenerate All Draw.io Exports" from the workflows list
3. Click "Run workflow" and configure the options:
   - Set "Force processing" to `true` if you want to overwrite existing files
4. Click "Run workflow" to start the process

This will process all diagrams in the repository, regardless of when they were last changed. See the [Manual Regeneration Guide](scripts/manual-regeneration-guide.md) for more details.

## Resolving Common Issues

1. **File Not Being Converted**: If a file with spaces isn't being converted:
   - Check that it's properly detected in the "Files to process" list in the logs
   - Ensure the direct processing section is running
   - Verify the file path doesn't contain special characters beyond spaces

2. **Missing Changelog Entries**: If a file is converted but not appearing in the changelog:
   - Verify the `FILE_CHANGED` flag is set to true
   - Check for errors in the change type detection
   - Ensure proper escaping of special characters in the CSV entry

## Commit Hash Tracking

Each changelog entry includes a short commit hash for tracking purposes. The commit hash is stored in the "Commit Hash" column (column 8) of the CHANGELOG.csv file and is preserved when uploading to SharePoint. This allows for easy tracking of which commit introduced each change to a diagram file.

### Using Commit Hashes

You can use the commit hash to track diagram changes or restore previous versions:

1. **View an old version**:
   ```zsh
   # Using the short hash from the changelog
   git show abcd123:path/to/file.drawio
   
   # Or get a complete list of changes for a file
   git log --follow --oneline path/to/file.drawio
   ```

2. **Restore to an earlier version**:
   ```zsh
   # Checkout a specific version using the hash from the changelog
   git checkout abcd123 -- path/to/file.drawio
   
   # Then commit the restored version
   git commit -m "Restored file to version abcd123"
   ```

3. **Compare versions**:
   ```zsh
   # Compare a file between two commit hashes
   git diff abcd123 efgh456 -- path/to/file.drawio
   ```

4. **View full commit details**:
   ```zsh
   # Get complete information about the commit
   git show abcd123
   ```

The short hash format (e.g., "abcd123") is used in the changelog for readability, but contains all the information needed to uniquely identify the commit.

## Version Tracking Logic

- New files start at version 1.0
- Minor changes increment the minor version (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1)
- Major changes (detected via keywords) increment the major version and reset minor (e.g., 1.1 → 2.0)

## Changelog Format

The CHANGELOG.csv file has the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Date | The date when the change was processed (dd.mm.yyyy) |
| Time | The time when the change was processed (hh:mm:ss) |
| User | The Git username of the person who made the change |
| Diagram | The name of the diagram without extension |
| Action | Either "New" or "Modified (Update)" |
| File | The conversion path (e.g., "diagram.drawio to diagram.html") |
| Commit Message | The Git commit message associated with the change |
| Version | The calculated version number (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0") |
| Commit Hash | The short Git commit hash for tracking |
| ID | The diagram ID number (if available in the filename) |

This format is preserved when uploading to SharePoint, ensuring all metadata is available for reference. The ID column is particularly useful for tracking diagrams across different versions and branches.
