# Conflict Resolution Improvements in Diagram Workflows

## Handling Modify/Delete Conflicts for Renamed Files

When diagrams are renamed by adding an ID (e.g., `13.drawio` â†’ `13 (ID 015).drawio`), this creates a special kind of Git conflict called a "modify/delete conflict". This happens when:

1. One branch renames a file (which Git treats as deleting the original and creating a new file)
2. Another branch modifies the original file

When these branches merge, Git sees that one branch deleted a file while the other modified it, creating a conflict.

### Problem Description

Previously, the workflow would fail with errors like:

```
CONFLICT (modify/delete): html_files/13.html deleted in HEAD and modified in origin/main.
error: path 'html_files/13.html' does not have our version
error: path 'svg_files/13.svg' does not have our version
```

This happens because:
- The workflow tried to use `git checkout --ours $file` for all conflicts
- For modify/delete conflicts, this approach fails because our version is the deleted version
- Git can't check out a file that doesn't exist in our version

### Intelligent Conflict Resolution

The improved workflow now handles modify/delete conflicts with a smart strategy:

1. **Detect the conflict type**: Is it a modify/delete conflict?
   ```bash
   if git status | grep -q "deleted by us:.*$file"; then
     # This is a modify/delete conflict where we deleted the file
     # ...
   ```

2. **Check for renamed versions**: Does a renamed version with an ID exist?
   ```bash
   if find . -name "${file%.*} (ID*" 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
     # Found renamed version with ID
     # ...
   ```

3. **Apply the appropriate strategy**:
   - If a renamed version exists: Accept our deletion of the original, as we've renamed it
   - If no renamed version exists: Keep the remote version to avoid data loss
   - For other conflict types: Use standard conflict resolution

## Recent Improvements

### Fixed Shell Syntax Error with Parentheses

A shell syntax error was occurring when handling file paths with parentheses in the conflict resolution code. The issue was with this line:

```bash
if find . -name "${file%.*} (ID*" 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
```

The parentheses in this pattern were interpreted as shell syntax rather than literal characters, causing errors.

#### The Fix

We replaced the problematic `ls` command with a more robust approach using `find`:

```bash
if find . -name "${file%.*} (ID*" 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
```

This solution has several advantages:
1. It properly handles parentheses in file paths without requiring explicit escaping
2. It's more reliable because `find` has better pattern matching capabilities
3. The `grep -q .` ensures we handle the output correctly, returning a proper exit code

This fix was applied to all workflow files and test scripts to ensure consistent behavior across the entire system.

## Benefits

This improved conflict resolution strategy:

1. **Prevents errors** in workflows when diagrams are renamed with IDs
2. **Preserves data integrity** by preventing accidental data loss
3. **Handles edge cases** like concurrent renaming and editing
4. **Reduces manual intervention** needed for resolving conflicts
5. **Makes workflows more robust** against various Git merge scenarios
